# Reviewing Classes and Objects
# This code expands on the example shown in the lecture videos

# Some documentation is included as an example (in mostly Google Style). The documentation is not complete!
# All methods should have their own docstrings unless otherwise specified (i.e. __init__ and  properties)
# The specifics of other formats may vary- you may choose whichever format you prefer as long as you are consistent.
