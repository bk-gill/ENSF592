# Some documentation is included as an example (in mostly Google Style). The documentation is not complete!
# All methods should have their own docstrings unless otherwise specified (i.e. __init__ and  properties)
# The specifics of other formats may vary- you may choose whichever format you prefer as long as you are consistent.

    # Create five horses and five riders.


    # Exercise 1
    # Collect all horse and rider ages and create a single set that lists each number that appears at least once.
    # A large competition is planned for 5 years from now. All riders must be over 20, but under 50. Horses must be over 10 and under 25.
    # Create either a single generator function or separate generator expressions that can be used to find which horses and riders will be eligible for the competition.
    # Print out their names.


    # Exercise 2
    # Use a regular expression to find all competition-eligible horses and riders with names containing both "A/a" and "L/l"


    # Exercise 3:
    # Customize the setter for horse age by adding an exception. 
    # Age must be set to a value greater than zero, otherwise a message is printed to the user using a ValueError exception.




    # Want some additional practice? Try the following.

    # Practice 1:
    # Customize the setter for the rider's name so that only letters from A-Z/a-z are accepted.

    # Practice 2:
    # Use a regular expression to find all horse breeds that end with "an".

    # Practice 3:
    # Construct a single set that lists all unique horse colours.

    # Practice 4:
    # Create both a generator expression and its equivalent generator function that can be used to calculate how old each rider will be in 2031.
    # Create tuples to pair each rider with their future age. Print out the results.

    # Practice 5:
    # Create a dictionary where the rider's name is the key and their assigned horse is the value. Use the dictionary to find and print the name of Ali's horse.
